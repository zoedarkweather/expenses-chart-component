## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript


### What I learned
A little bit about how to work with dates in JavaScript: how to return today's date, and how to get the day of the week from the date. I also got more good practice with CSS. I found getting the chart to display properly with hidden elements and dynamically sized content to be a little challenging at first.


### Continued development

Keep practicing with JavaScript and CSS.
